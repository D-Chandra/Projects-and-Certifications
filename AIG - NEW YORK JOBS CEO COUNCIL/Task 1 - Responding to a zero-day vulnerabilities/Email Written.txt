CVE-2021-45046
CVE-2021-45105

Log4Shell and CVE-2021-45046 are being actively exploited that uses Log4j library, versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, Vulnerability exists in the action the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) takes to resolve variables, affected versions of Log4j contain JNDI features such as Message lookup substitution, Domain Name System (DNS), other JNDI related endpoints. An adversary can exploit Log4Shell by Submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary code

Apache has rated Log4Shell and CVE-2021-45046 as critical and CVE-2021-45105 as high on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Allowing full control over the system, Steal information, launch ransomware, Denial-of-service (DoS) condition or conduct other malicious activity. FBI has observed attempted exploitation and widespread scanning of Log4j to deploy crypto mining and botnet malware.

Immediately identify, mitigate, and update affected products that use Log4j to the latest patched version

Mitigate known and suspected vulnerable assets in your environment, should be isolated until they are mitigated and verified, Patch Log4j and other affected products to the latest version: -

Environments using Java 8 or later, upgrade to Log4j version 2.17.0
Environments using Java 7, upgrade to Log4j version 2.12.3

Java 7 is currently end of life and organizations should upgrade to Java 8

Verify the mitigation has worked, if possible

Scan the patched/mitigated asset with the tools and methods, use more than one method

Initiate hunt and incident response procedures

Hunt for signs of exploitation and compromise
